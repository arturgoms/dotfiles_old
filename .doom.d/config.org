#+TITLE: DOOM Config
#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle config.el

* ABOUT THIS CONFIG
This is my personal Doom Emacs config.

* HOW TO USE IT
The only thing you need to do is to run the command org-tangle or hit <C-c><C-v>t

* DASHBOARD
Emacs Dashboard is an extensible startup screen showing you recent files, bookmarks, agenda items and an Emacs banner.

** Configuring Dashboard
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package dashboard
  :init      ;; tweak dashboard config before loading it
  (setq dashboard-set-heading-icons t)
  (setq dashboard-set-file-icons t)
  (setq dashboard-banner-logo-title "\nKEYBINDINGS:\
\nFind file               (SPC .)     \
Open buffer list    (SPC b i)\
\nFind recent files       (SPC f r)   \
Open the eshell     (SPC e s)\
\nOpen dired file manager (SPC d d)   \
List of keybindings (SPC h b b)")
  ;;(setq dashboard-startup-banner 'logo) ;; use standard emacs logo as banner
  (setq dashboard-startup-banner "~/.config/doom/doom-emacs-dash.png")  ;; use custom image as banner
  (setq dashboard-center-content nil) ;; set to 't' for centered content
  (setq dashboard-items '((recents . 5)
                          (agenda . 5 )

** Dashboard in Emacsclient
This setting ensures that emacsclient always opens on *dashboard* rather than *scratch*.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-fallback-buffer "*dashboard*")
#+end_src

* DOOM THEME
Setting the theme to doom-one.  To try out new themes, I set a keybinding for counsel-load-theme with 'SPC h t'.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq doom-theme 'doom-one)
(map! :leader
      :desc "Load new theme" "h t" #'counsel-load-theme)
#+END_SRC

* BEACON
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(beacon-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

* BOOKMARKS AND BUFFERS
Doom Emacs uses 'SPC b' for keybindings related to bookmarks and buffers.

** Bookmark
Bookmark are somewhat like registers in that they record positions you can jump to.  Unlike registers, they have long names, and they persist automatically from one Emacs session to the next. The prototypical use of bookmarks is to record where you were reading in various files.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(map! :leader
      (:prefix ("b". "buffer")
       :desc "List bookmarks" "L" #'list-bookmarks
       :desc "Save current bookmarks to bookmark file" "w" #'bookmark-save))
#+END_SRC

** Buffers
Regarding /buffers/, the text you are editing in Emacs resides in an object called a /buffer/. Each time you visit a file, a buffer is used to hold the file‚Äôs text. Each time you invoke Dired, a buffer is used to hold the directory listing.  /Ibuffer/ is a program that lists all of your Emacs /buffers/, allowing you to navigate between them and filter them.

| COMMAND         | DESCRIPTION          | KEYBINDING |
|-----------------+----------------------+------------|
| ibuffer         | Launch ibuffer       | SPC b i    |
| kill-buffer     | Kill current buffer  | SPC b k    |
| next-buffer     | Goto next buffer     | SPC b n    |
| previous-buffer | Goto previous buffer | SPC b p    |
| save-buffer     | Save current buffer  | SPC b s    |

** Global Auto Revert
A buffer can get out of sync with respect to its visited file on disk if that file is changed by another program. To keep it up to date, you can enable Auto Revert mode by typing M-x auto-revert-mode, or you can set it to be turned on globally with 'global-auto-revert-mode'.  I have also turned on Global Auto Revert on non-file buffers, which is especially useful for 'dired' buffers.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-auto-revert-mode 1)
(setq global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers t)
#+end_src

* CENTAUR-TABS
To use tabs in Doom Emacs, be sure to uncomment "tabs" in Doom's init.el.  Displays tabs at the top of the window similar to tabbed web browsers such as Firefox.  I don't actually use tabs in Emacs.  I placed this in my config to help others who may want tabs.  In the default configuration of Doom Emacs, 'SPC t' is used for "toggle" keybindings, so I choose 'SPC t c' to toggle centaur-tabs.  The "g" prefix for keybindings is used for a bunch of evil keybindings in Doom, but "g" plus the arrow keys were not used, so I thought I would bind those for tab navigation.  But I did leave the default "g t" and "g T" intact if you prefer to use those for centaur-tabs-forward/backward.

| COMMAND                     | DESCRIPTION               | KEYBINDING       |

* DIRED
Dired is the file manager within Emacs.  Below, I setup keybindings for image previews (peep-dired).  Doom Emacs does not use 'SPC d' for any of its keybindings, so I've chosen the format of 'SPC d' plus 'key'.

* IVY
Ivy is a generic completion mechanism for Emacs.

** IVY-POSFRAME
Ivy-posframe is an ivy extension, which lets ivy use posframe to show its candidate menu.  Some of the settings below involve:
+ ivy-posframe-display-functions-alist -- sets the display position for specific programs
+ ivy-posframe-height-alist -- sets the height of the list displayed for specific programs

Available functions (positions) for 'ivy-posframe-display-functions-alist'
+ ivy-posframe-display-at-frame-center
+ ivy-posframe-display-at-window-center
+ ivy-posframe-display-at-frame-bottom-left
+ ivy-posframe-display-at-window-bottom-left
+ ivy-posframe-display-at-frame-bottom-window-center
+ ivy-posframe-display-at-point
+ ivy-posframe-display-at-frame-top-center

=NOTE:= If the setting for 'ivy-posframe-display' is set to 'nil' (false), anything that is set to 'ivy-display-function-fallback' will just default to their normal position in Doom Emacs (usually a bottom split).  However, if this is set to 't' (true), then the fallback position will be centered in the window.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

** IVY KEYBINDINGS
By default, Doom Emacs does not use 'SPC v', so the format I use for these bindings is 'SPC v' plus 'key'.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

* LINE SETTINGS
I set comment-line to 'SPC TAB TAB' which is a rather comfortable keybinding for me on my ZSA Moonlander keyboard.  The standard Emacs keybinding for comment-line is 'C-x C-;'.  The other keybindings are for commands that toggle on/off various line-related settings.  Doom Emacs uses 'SPC t' for "toggle" commands, so I choose 'SPC t' plus 'key' for those bindings.

| COMMAND                  | DESCRIPTION                               | KEYBINDING  |

* MINIMAP
A minimap sidebar displaying a smaller version of the current buffer on either the left or right side. It highlights the currently shown region and updates its position automatically.  Be aware that this minimap program does not work in Org documents.  This is not unusual though because I have tried several minimap programs and none of them can handle Org.

* NEOTREE
Neotree is a file tree viewer.  When you open neotree, it jumps to the current file thanks to neo-smart-open.  The neo-window-fixed-size setting makes the neotree width be adjustable.  Doom Emacs had no keybindings set for neotree.  Since Doom Emacs uses 'SPC t' for 'toggle' keybindings, I used 'SPC t n' for toggle-neotree.

* OPEN SPECIFIC FILES
Keybindings to open files that I work with all the time using the find-file command, which is the interactive file search that opens with 'C-x C-f' in GNU Emacs or 'SPC f f' in Doom Emacs.  These keybindings use find-file non-interactively since we specify exactly what file to open.  The format I use for these bindings is 'SPC =' plus 'key' since Doom Emacs does not use 'SPC ='.

* ORG MODE
I wrapped most of this block in (after! org).  Without this, my settings might be evaluated too early, which will result in my settings being overwritten by Doom's defaults.  I have also enabled org-journal, org-superstar and org-roam by adding (+journal +pretty +roam2) to the org section of my Doom Emacs init.el.

=NOTE:= I have the location of my Org directory and Roam directory in $HOME/nc/ which is a Nextcloud folder that allows me to instantly sync all of my Org work between my home computer and my office computer.

** Set font sizes for each header level in Org
You can set the Org heading levels to be different font sizes.  So I choose to have level 1 headings to be 140% in height, level 2 to be 130%, etc.  Other interesting things you could play with include adding :foreground color and/or :background color if you want to override the theme colors.

* PERSPECTIVE
Perspective provides multiple named workspaces (or "perspectives") in Emacs, similar to having multiple desktops in window managers like Awesome and XMonad.  Each perspective has its own buffer list and its own window layout, making it easy to work on many separate projects without getting lost in all the buffers.  Switching to a perspective activates its window configuration, and when in a perspective, only its buffers are available (by default).  Doom Emacs uses 'SPC some_key' for binding some of the perspective commands, so I used this binging format for the perspective bindings that I created..

* REGISTERS
Emacs registers are compartments where you can save text, rectangles and positions for later use. Once you save text or a rectangle in a register, you can copy it into the buffer once or many times; once you save a position in a register, you can jump back to that position once or many times.  The default GNU Emacs keybindings for these commands (with the exception of counsel-register) involves 'C-x r' followed by one or more other keys.  I wanted to make this a little more user friendly, and since I am using Doom Emacs, I choose to replace the 'C-x r' part of the key chords with 'SPC r'.

* SPLITS
I set splits to default to opening on the right using 'prefer-horizontal-split'.  I set a keybinding for 'clone-indirect-buffer-other-window' for when I want to have the same document in two splits.  The text of the indirect buffer is always identical to the text of its base buffer; changes made by editing either one are visible immediately in the other.  But in all other respects, the indirect buffer and its base buffer are completely separate.  For example, I can fold one split but other will be unfolded.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+END_SRC

* ZAP TO CHAR
Emacs provides a 'zap-to-char' command that kills from the current point to a character.  It is bound to 'M-z' in standard GNU Emacs but since Doom Emacs uses 'SPC' as its leader key and does not have 'SPC z' binded to anything, it just makes since to use it for 'zap-to-char'.  Note that 'zap-to-char' can be used with the universal argument 'SPC u' to modify its behavior.  Examples of 'zap-to-char' usage are listed in the table below:

| KEYBINDING                | WHAT IS DOES                                               |
|---------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------|
| SPC z e                   | deletes all chars to the next occurrence of 'e'            |
| SPC u 2 SPC z e           | deletes all chars to the second occurrence of 'e'          |
| SPC u - SPC z e           | deletes all chars to the previous occurrence of 'e'        |
| SPC u -2 SPC z e          | deletes all chars to the fourth previous occurrence of 'e' |
| SPC u 1 0 0 SPC u SPC z e | deletes all chars to the 100th occurrence of 'e'           |

=TIP:= The universal argument (SPC u) can only take a single integer by default.  If you need to use a multi-digit number (like 100 in the last example in the table above), then you must terminate the universal argument with another 'SPC u' after typing the number.

'zap-up-to-char' is an alternative command that does not zap the char specified.  It is binded to 'SPC Z'.  It can also be used in conjunction with the universal argument 'SPC u' in similar fashion to the the 'zap-to-char' examples above.

=NOTE:= Vim (evil mode) has similar functionality builtin.  You can delete to the next occurrence of 'e' by using 'dte' in normal.  To delete to the next occurrence of 'e' including the 'e', then you would use 'dfe'.  And you can modify 'dt' and 'df' by prefixing them with numbers, so '2dte' would delete to the second occurrence of 'e'.
